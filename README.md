# Python Wave Function Collapse Algorithm 
 Implementation of the WFC algorithm using python. 

 Uses the WFC algorithm to make a semi random image that looks similar and follows the patterns in a inital image.
 To use run the WFC file.
 If you want to change the config then add the images you want to use to the imgs folder and create a object of the tile class for each of them. Than change the initmap.array to the scene that you want it to create.
 Change the rows and colums varibles to change the size of the output array but keep them the same (or close to the same) to avoid stretching.
 The ITERATIONS varible increases the accuracy of the final array.
